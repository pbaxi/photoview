# photoview
A digital photo viewer that displays a description and comment with the image.

This simple viewer displays a photo image along with a description and comment
and date taken, all obtained (if present) from the exif data in the image file.

Better viewers undoubtably exist, but I found it necessary to write this because
I couldn't find another viewer that would display this information (without
all the other exif data).

The description and comment fields can be written to the jpeg file using
another of my projects, photodesc.

I hope this is of use to someone - I certainly find it useful - and I of course
welcome constructive suggestions, contributions etc.

Technical stuff.
It's written as a qt project using qt creator. The exiv2 library is used for
access to the exif data. It works ok on my Fedora Linux system and I would
not expect any problems with other Linux distributions. It's probably
portable to Windows, but since I don't use Windows myself I'm not really
interested in doing it.

According to the exif spec I found, the Photo.UserComment has, in its first 8
bytes, a zero padded format name (eg ascii). But looking at files from one
of my cameras I found this field began with charset="Ascii", and that this part
is not displayed when using the gnome image viewer, so I adopted the same
strategy.
